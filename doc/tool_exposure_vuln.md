Disclosure of AI Agent Toolsets as a Prompt Injection Vulnerability
Prompt Injection Risks from Disclosing AI Agent Toolsets
Background: AI Agents and Tool Use

Large Language Model (LLM) based AI agents increasingly integrate external tools (plugins, APIs, or system commands) to extend their capabilities beyond text generation. Frameworks like the ReAct prompt pattern allow AIs to interact with external systems. By equipping an AI with tool use, developers enable powerful new functionalities – for example, an agent can search the internet, read/write files, send emails, or run code in response to user instructions.

However, once an AI can take actions on a system or call external APIs, a maliciously crafted prompt or input can potentially trick the agent into performing unintended or harmful operations.

One foundational vulnerability class in this context is prompt injection – where an attacker supplies input that subverts the agent’s instructions or intentions. Initially seen as playful or low-risk, prompt injection becomes “genuinely dangerous” when applied to agents with tool capabilities. An injected instruction could drive the AI to invoke powerful tools in an unintended way.

Vulnerability Overview: Toolset Disclosure

An often-overlooked aspect of this vulnerability is the disclosure of the AI agent’s available toolset. If an AI assistant explicitly reveals which tools or plugins it has access to (for instance, through documentation or in response to user queries), it enables attackers to target those tools directly.

Many tool-using AI systems provide such information by design. For example, the Auto-GPT agent includes a list of functions in its prompt context:
Code

1. analyze_code – Analyze Code
2. execute_python_code – Create a Python file and execute it
3. execute_python_file – Execute Python File
...
10. google – Google Search
12. browse_website – Browse Website
... (16 commands total)

If an attacker sees or infers such a tool list, they can tailor their prompt injection to invoke these commands. If the agent’s prompt or prior conversation confirms the tool names and syntax, the attack has a higher chance of success because the model “knows” those are valid actions it can take.

Even when the toolset is not explicitly announced to the end-user, attackers can often discover it through indirect means or assume a default. Many LLM frameworks have well-known plugins and APIs.

In summary:
The vulnerability lies in the combination of:

    The agent’s inability to perfectly separate malicious instructions from benign data.
    The agent having powerful tools exposed to user or input control.

Threat Model: Prompt Injection and Indirect Injection

Prompt injection in this context refers to any technique by which an attacker supplies input that alters the AI agent’s intended behavior and causes it to perform unauthorized actions via its tools.
Types of Attacks

    Direct Prompt Injection:
    The attacker directly interacts with the AI (as a user or via an API) and provides carefully crafted prompts that override the system’s instructions.

    Indirect Prompt Injection:
    The attacker embeds the malicious instruction in some content that the AI will process (e.g., document, email, website, image). The AI unwittingly incorporates the attacker’s hidden prompt into its context and may execute it.

Potential Impacts

    Data Exfiltration:
    Coaxing the AI to leak sensitive information (personal data, API keys, database records, chat history, etc.).

    Unauthorized Actions / System Compromise:
    Getting the AI to perform actions that harm the user or system (e.g., sending unauthorized messages, executing harmful commands).

    Policy Evasion / Misuse of AI:
    Using prompt injection to bypass safety restrictions, such as instructing the AI to perform actions it should not.

The indirect prompt injection scenario is especially insidious. It often requires no action on the part of the victim beyond normal use of the AI agent (sometimes called a “zero-click” attack).

Prior Art and Similar Vulnerabilities

The vulnerability of tool-enabled AI agents to prompt injection has been well-documented. Early warnings came as soon as autonomous agent frameworks emerged. For instance, Simon Willison’s blog post “Prompt injection: What’s the worst that can happen?” highlighted scenarios such as an email assistant being tricked by an incoming email to forward sensitive messages to an attacker.

Academic research (e.g., InjecAgent benchmark) and industry guidelines (OWASP) have reinforced that prompt-tool injection is a systemic weakness in many agent implementations.
Real-World Exploits

    Microsoft 365 Copilot:
    Researchers showed that if Copilot read a malicious email/document, it could be induced to invoke internal tools, causing data exfiltration.

    Anthropic Claude “Computer Use” mode:
    Prompt injections in PDFs and web pages could cause full system compromise.

    Terminal/CLI Integrations:
    Vulnerabilities like “Terminal DiLLMa” used the AI’s output to attack systems by embedding malicious payloads in the output text.

    ChatGPT Plugins and API:
    Prompt injection could cause ChatGPT to invoke plugins without explicit user intent.

Exploitability in Real-World AI Agents

    Attack Channels:
    Chat interfaces, web-browsing agents, knowledge bases, images, documents, emails, and more.

    Autonomy and User Confirmation:
    The risk is higher in autonomous or multi-step agents that execute actions without user confirmation.

    Severity:
    Harm can range from privacy breaches to full system compromise, including remote code execution or destructive commands.

    Defenses:
    Modern agents have some guardrails, but clever attackers can use evasion techniques to bypass them.

Mitigations and Recommendations

    Principle of Least Privilege:
    Limit what the AI agent can do to the minimum necessary.
    Input Sanitization and Content Filtering:
    Treat all external content as potentially malicious and pre-process accordingly.
    Structured Prompting and Role Separation:
    Structure the AI’s prompt to separate system instructions from user data.
    Output Monitoring and Post-Processing:
    Validate any tool invocation before execution.
    Human-in-the-Loop:
    Require explicit confirmation for sensitive actions.
    Continual Training and Model Guardrails:
    Improve models’ abilities to detect and refuse malicious instructions.
    Isolating and Sandboxing Agent Actions:
    Limit the fallout if an AI is compromised.
    Monitoring and Logging:
    Log actions and interactions for forensic analysis.
    Avoid Toolset Disclosure:
    Do not voluntarily disclose the list of tools/plugins to end-users or in prompts visible to end-users.

Conclusion

AI agents with tool-using capabilities are powerful but introduce significant risks—especially when their toolset is disclosed to users or attackers. This risk is well-documented in research and real-world exploits. Awareness is increasing, but mitigation remains a challenge.

Organizations deploying such integrations should apply traditional security principles and treat AI outputs/actions with skepticism and rigor.
